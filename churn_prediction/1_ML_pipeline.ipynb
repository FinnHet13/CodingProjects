    "\n",
    "The F-2 score is chosen because it merges recall and precision into a single score, providing a good blend between how well the model can predict churners well and if it overpredicts non-churners to be churners. Unlike the F-1 score, the F-2 score puts more emphasis on recall than on precision. This makes sense because the telcom company should be more concerned about correctly predicting all possible churning customers (recall) than predicting too many non-churning customers to be churners (precision) because a churned customer likely costs the company a lot more than being overcareful with a non-churning customer. On the other hand, just focusing entirely on recall will incentivize the model just to predict all customers as churners which is not ideal because it will involve a lot of unnecessary effort on the part of the telcom company to keep customers happy that are not planning on leaving in the first place. Therefore, the F-2 score provides a very good balance and makes most sense to me as a performance metric."

    "I selected accuracy as the performance metric because that is the metric the professor said the models will have their performance graded on. Otherwise, I would have chosen the F-2 score. The F-2 score merges recall and precision into a single score, providing a good blend between how well the model can predict churners well and if it overpredicts non-churners to be churners. Unlike the F-1 score, the F-2 score puts more emphasis on recall than on precision. This makes sense because the telcom company should be more concerned about correctly predicting all possible churning customers (recall) than predicting too many non-churning customers to be churners (precision) because a churned customer likely costs the company a lot more than being overcareful with a non-churning customer. On the other hand, just focusing entirely on recall will incentivize the model just to predict all customers as churners which is not ideal because it will involve a lot of unnecessary effort on the part of the telcom company to keep customers happy that are not planning on leaving in the first place. Therefore, the F-2 score provides a very good balance and makes most sense to me as a performance metric."
