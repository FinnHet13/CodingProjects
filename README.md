# Hi, I'm Finn Hetzler!
Relentlessly curious and passionate about bridging business insights with computer science, I aim to build solutions for *actual* problems. My driving goal is to leverage technology in ways that genuinely boost productivity and thereby lower stress for as many people as possible.

This repo serves as my space to share my coding progress – largely self-taught – through various projects. Follow along, and please feel free to share feedback – I'm always open to it!

# Tech Stack
- Primary language: Python
- Other languages: SQL, R
- Softwares I've worked with: PowerBI, Tableau, Databricks, MS Excel, MS Dynamics 365, Matomo, Altaire RapidMiner

# Projects (from newest to oldest)
- [Predicting Churn with Machine Learning](https://github.com/FinnHet13/CodingProjects/tree/main/churn_prediction): I trained two machine learning models to predict customer churn of a Telcom company, factoring in the higher relative costs of churning than retaining a customer, to find the model that would minimize cost for the company. This project taught me to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline and compare models to solve a business case. The most interesting learning though was testing the limits of the current state of the art AI models Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Gemini 2.5, specifically learning how to prompt these models precisely and seeing what the models are already capable of (Spoiler: at least to me, a lot!).

- [Sentiment Analysis with Transformer Models](https://github.com/FinnHet13/CodingProjects/tree/main/sentiment_analysis_bachelor_thesis): I benchmarked three pre-trained transformer models from Hugging Face on their sentiment analysis performance on a dataset of task-based dialogues to find the best model for analyzing sentiment on customer service calls. This project taught me how to work with pre-trained deep learning models and improved my Python skills greatly. The most interesting learning was cutting down the processing time of my code by 40% from 1:45hr to 1:03hr by batching the input text and using parallel processing.
- Keep an eye out for upcoming projects!
