# Hi, I'm Finn Hetzler! 
![That's me :)](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E03AQEdx8Dt3RLFBA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1621583437966?e=1744243200&v=beta&t=1RlpE67qIckkf4KwOTaqgyapDCrkVfAIURdZbsqltcg)

# About Me
I'm an aspiring Data Scientist with a passion for data analysis and automation, always with the goal of adding value in terms of time savings and providing data-driven insights that make a change. This GitHub repo is the space where I want to share my coding progress through various projects.

# Tech Stack
- Primary language: Python
- Other languages: SQL, R
- Softwares I've worked with: PowerBI, Tableau, Databricks, MS Excel, MS Dynamics 365, Matomo, Altaire RapidMiner

# Projects
- [Sentiment Analysis Bachelor Thesis](https://github.com/FinnHet13/CodingProjects/tree/main/sentiment_analysis_bachelor_thesis): I benchmarked three pre-trained transformer models from Hugging Face on their sentiment analysis performance on a dataset of task-based dialogues to find the best model for analyzing sentiment on customer service calls. This project taught me how to work with deep learning models and improved my Python skills greatly. The most interesting takeaway was cutting down the processing time of my code by 40% from 1:45hr to 1:03hr by batching the input text and using parallel processing.
- Keep an eye out for upcoming projects!
